<h1>Popular Movies using MovieDB API </h1>

    . A project to be used on the FullStack Developer couse at Udacity


This project was developed using the Python Programming Language and MovieDB API (https://developers.themoviedb.org)

To use it´s API is necessário to create a developer account and then you´ll receive a API Key.

To make it easier to use i did let one key as example directly at my code.

Also the results are paginated and the api always returns 20 items per page, so
this example is taking at account only the first page of the popular movies request. 

To run it:
    
* 1 - execute with the command: python project_1_movies.py </li>
* 2 - put your API KEY </li>
* 3 - choose how many movies you want to show </li>
